## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Compliance

### Enterprise WebSocket Design Patterns ‚úÖ
- **Service-Oriented Architecture**: Each WebSocket feature implemented as separate, focused service
- **Dependency Injection**: Proper NestJS DI patterns for service integration
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Services communicate through events for loose coupling
- **Hexagonal Architecture**: Clean separation between domain, application, and infrastructure layers

### Real-Time Features ‚úÖ
```typescript
// Enhanced presence tracking
interface UserPresence {
  userId: string;
  status: UserStatus; // ONLINE, AWAY, BUSY, OFFLINE
  isOnline: boolean;
  lastSeen: number;
  lastActivity: number;
  deviceId?: string;
  customStatus?: string;
  activityType?: 'typing' | 'reading' | 'idle' | 'active';
}

// Smart broadcasting optimization
interface EventBroadcast {
  eventType: string;
  recipients: Set<string>;
  priority: 'critical' | 'normal' | 'low';
  batchable: boolean;
  roomFilter?: string[];
}
```

### Performance Optimizations ‚úÖ
- **Event Batching**: Groups multiple events for efficient network usage
- **Intelligent Filtering**: Only sends events to relevant users
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of stale connections and data
- **Caching Strategy**: Event caching with TTL for frequently accessed data

## üöÄ Key Features Implemented

### Real-Time Synchronization
```typescript
// Automatic database sync
await realtimeSyncService.syncEvent('message:created', {
  messageId: message.id,
  roomId: message.roomId,
  authorId: message.authorId
});
```

### Smart Broadcasting
```typescript
// Optimized message broadcasting
await broadcastingService.broadcastToRoom(roomId, 'receiveMessage', message, {
  excludeUsers: [authorId],
  priority: 'normal',
  batchable: true
});
```

### Offline Message Support
```typescript
// Queue messages for offline users
await messageQueueService.queueForUser(userId, {
  type: 'message:received',
  data: message,
  priority: MessagePriority.HIGH
});
```

### Advanced Presence Management
```typescript
// Multi-device presence tracking
await presenceService.setUserOnline(userId, deviceId, UserStatus.ONLINE);
await presenceService.updateActivity(userId, 'typing', { roomId });
```

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Service Dependencies
```typescript
// Typical service dependency structure
@Injectable()
export class RealtimeSyncService {
  constructor(
    @Inject(MESSAGE_REPOSITORY_TOKEN) 
    private messageRepository: IMessageRepository,
    private logger: Logger
  ) {}
}
```

### Event Processing Pipeline
```typescript
// Event flow through services
1. ChatGateway receives WebSocket event
2. RealtimeSyncService validates and processes
3. BroadcastingService determines recipients  
4. MessageQueueService handles offline users
5. PresenceService updates user activity
```

### Performance Metrics
```typescript
// Built-in performance monitoring
interface ServiceMetrics {
  eventsProcessed: number;
  averageProcessingTime: number;
  errorRate: number;
  activeConnections: number;
  queueSizes: Record<string, number>;
}
```
