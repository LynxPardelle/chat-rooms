# Phase 1: Setup Inicial del Proyecto - Validation Plan

This document contains the validation plan for Phase 1 of the Chat Rooms application development.

## 🏗️ Phase 1: Setup Inicial del Proyecto

### Step 1.1: Estructura Base del Monorepo

#### ✅ Validation Checklist

- [ ] **Directory Structure Validation**

  ```bash
  # Verify monorepo structure exists
  ls -la / | grep -E "(api|front|README.md|package.json|.gitignore)"
  
  # Check root package.json has global scripts
  cat package.json | jq '.scripts'
  ```

- [ ] **Documentation Quality**
  - [ ] README.md contains clear setup instructions
  - [ ] Installation steps are documented
  - [ ] Development workflow is explained
  - [ ] Contributing guidelines are present

- [ ] **Git Configuration**
  - [ ] .gitignore covers all necessary files (node_modules, .env, logs, etc.)
  - [ ] Repository initializes correctly
  - [ ] No sensitive files are tracked

#### 🧪 Test Commands

```bash
# Clone and setup test
git clone <repository>
cd chat-rooms
npm install
npm run setup  # Should run setup for both api and front
```

#### 📊 Success Criteria

- ✅ Monorepo structure is clean and organized
- ✅ Documentation is comprehensive and clear
- ✅ Git ignores all sensitive and generated files
- ✅ Global scripts work correctly

### Step 1.2: Setup Backend (NestJS)

#### ✅ Backend Validation Checklist

- [ ] **NestJS Setup Validation**

  ```bash
  cd api
  npm run start:dev
  # Should start without errors using SWC compiler
  ```

- [ ] **Hexagonal Architecture Structure**
  - [ ] `src/application/` directory exists with proper modules
  - [ ] `src/domain/` directory contains entities and value objects
  - [ ] `src/infrastructure/` directory has database and external adapters
  - [ ] `src/presentation/` directory contains controllers and DTOs

- [ ] **Dependency Installation**
  - [ ] All required packages are installed correctly
  - [ ] SWC compiler is configured and working
  - [ ] TypeScript configuration is optimized

- [ ] **Performance Validation**

  ```bash
  # Test SWC compilation speed
  time npm run build
  # Should be significantly faster than TSC
  ```

#### 🧪 Backend Test Commands

```bash
cd api
npm install
npm run lint
npm run test
npm run build
npm run start:dev
curl http://localhost:3001  # Should get response
```

#### 📊 Backend Success Criteria

- ✅ NestJS application starts without errors
- ✅ SWC compilation is faster than TSC
- ✅ Hexagonal architecture directories are properly structured
- ✅ All dependencies install and build successfully

### Step 1.3: Setup Frontend (Vue 3 + TypeScript)

#### ✅ Frontend Validation Checklist

- [ ] **Vue 3 Setup Validation**

  ```bash
  cd front
  npm run dev
  # Should start Vite dev server successfully
  ```

- [ ] **Modular Architecture Structure**
  - [ ] `src/modules/` directory for feature modules
  - [ ] `src/core/` directory for core services
  - [ ] `src/shared/` directory for shared components
  - [ ] `src/types/` directory for TypeScript definitions

- [ ] **Component Structure Validation**
  - [ ] Components follow Vue 3 SFC structure (template, script, style)
  - [ ] TypeScript is properly configured
  - [ ] Composition API is used consistently

- [ ] **Development Experience**

  ```bash
  # Test hot reload and TypeScript checking
  npm run dev
  # Make changes to components and verify hot reload works
  ```

#### 🧪 Frontend Test Commands

```bash
cd front
npm install
npm run lint
npm run test:unit
npm run build
npm run preview
```

#### 📊 Frontend Success Criteria

- ✅ Vue 3 application starts and runs without errors
- ✅ Modular architecture is properly implemented
- ✅ TypeScript compilation works correctly
- ✅ Hot reload and development tools function properly

## 🎯 Phase 1 Completion Criteria

Before proceeding to Phase 2, ensure:

- ✅ All validation checklists are completed
- ✅ All test commands pass successfully
- ✅ Success criteria are met for all steps
- ✅ Code quality standards are maintained
- ✅ Documentation is comprehensive and up-to-date

## 📝 Next Steps

Once Phase 1 validation is complete, proceed to [Phase 2: Database Configuration](./phase-2-database.md).
