# Phase 10: Deployment - Validation Plan

This document contains the validation plan for Phase 10 of the Chat Rooms application development.

## 🚀 Phase 10: Deployment

### Step 10.1: Docker Production

#### ✅ Docker Production Validation Checklist

- [ ] **Production Docker Images**

  ```bash
  # Build production images
  docker build -f api/Dockerfile.prod -t chat-rooms-api:prod api/
  docker build -f front/Dockerfile.prod -t chat-rooms-front:prod front/
  
  # Test production containers
  docker run -d --name api-prod chat-rooms-api:prod
  docker run -d --name front-prod chat-rooms-front:prod
  ```

- [ ] **Security Hardening**
  - [ ] Non-root user in containers
  - [ ] Minimal base images used
  - [ ] Security patches applied
  - [ ] Secrets management configured

- [ ] **Performance Optimization**
  - [ ] Multi-stage builds minimize image size
  - [ ] Layer caching is optimized
  - [ ] Health checks are configured
  - [ ] Resource limits are set

#### 🧪 Docker Production Test Commands

```bash
# Production deployment tests
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml ps
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs
```

#### 📊 Docker Production Success Criteria

- ✅ Production images build successfully
- ✅ Security hardening is complete
- ✅ Performance is optimized for production
- ✅ Health checks confirm service health

### Step 10.2: CI/CD Pipeline

#### ✅ CI/CD Pipeline Validation Checklist

- [ ] **Pipeline Stages**

  ```yaml
  # Verify pipeline configuration
  # 1. Code checkout
  # 2. Dependency installation
  # 3. Testing (unit, integration, security)
  # 4. Building
  # 5. Deployment
  ```

- [ ] **Quality Gates**
  - [ ] Tests must pass before deployment
  - [ ] Security scans must pass
  - [ ] Performance tests must pass
  - [ ] Code coverage thresholds met

- [ ] **Deployment Strategy**
  - [ ] Blue-green deployment works
  - [ ] Rollback mechanisms function
  - [ ] Zero-downtime deployment
  - [ ] Environment promotion pipeline

#### 🧪 CI/CD Pipeline Test Commands

```bash
# CI/CD pipeline tests
# Test pipeline locally with Act or similar
act -j test
act -j build
act -j deploy
```

#### 📊 CI/CD Pipeline Success Criteria

- ✅ CI/CD pipeline runs without errors
- ✅ Quality gates prevent bad deployments
- ✅ Deployment strategy ensures zero downtime
- ✅ Rollback procedures work correctly

### Step 10.3: Deployment HA

#### ✅ High Availability Validation Checklist

- [ ] **Multi-region Setup**

  ```bash
  # Test infrastructure deployment
  terraform plan -var="environment=production"
  terraform apply -auto-approve
  
  # Verify resources in both regions
  aws ec2 describe-instances --region us-east-1
  aws ec2 describe-instances --region us-west-2
  ```

- [ ] **Failover Testing**
  - [ ] Primary region failure simulation
  - [ ] Automatic failover to secondary region
  - [ ] DNS routing updates correctly
  - [ ] Database failover works

- [ ] **Load Balancing**
  - [ ] Health checks detect unhealthy instances
  - [ ] Auto-scaling responds to load
  - [ ] Load distribution is even
  - [ ] Session affinity works correctly

#### 🧪 High Availability Test Commands

```bash
# High availability tests
npm run test:ha:failover
npm run test:ha:scaling
npm run test:ha:load-balancing
npm run test:ha:disaster-recovery
```

#### 📊 High Availability Success Criteria

- ✅ Multi-region deployment works correctly
- ✅ Failover mechanisms are reliable
- ✅ Auto-scaling handles load effectively
- ✅ 99.99% uptime target is achievable

## 🎯 Phase 10 Completion Criteria

Before final project approval, ensure:

- ✅ All validation checklists are completed
- ✅ All test commands pass successfully
- ✅ Success criteria are met for all steps
- ✅ Production Docker images are secure and optimized
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline ensures reliable deployments
- ✅ High availability setup meets enterprise requirements

## 📝 Next Steps

Once Phase 10 validation is complete, proceed to [Production Readiness](./production-readiness.md) and [Final Project Approval](./final-approval.md).
