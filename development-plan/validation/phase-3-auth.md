# Phase 3: Backend - Autenticación y Seguridad - Validation Plan

This document contains the validation plan for Phase 3 of the Chat Rooms application development.

## 🔐 Phase 3: Backend - Autenticación y Seguridad

### Step 3.1: Configuración JWT y Guards

#### ✅ Authentication Validation Checklist

- [ ] **Authentication Flow**

  ```bash
  # Test user registration
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/auth/register \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"username":"test","email":"test@test.com","password":"password123"}'
  
  # Test user login
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/auth/login \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"email":"test@test.com","password":"password123"}'
  ```

- [ ] **JWT Token Validation**
  - [ ] Access tokens are generated correctly (15min expiry)
  - [ ] Refresh tokens are generated correctly (7d expiry)
  - [ ] Token validation works in guards
  - [ ] Token refresh mechanism functions properly

- [ ] **Security Guards**
  - [ ] Protected routes require valid JWT
  - [ ] Optional guards work for public routes
  - [ ] Role-based access control functions
  - [ ] WebSocket authentication works

- [ ] **Security Headers and Middleware**
  - [ ] Helmet security headers are applied
  - [ ] CORS is configured correctly
  - [ ] Rate limiting is active
  - [ ] Input validation works

#### 🧪 Authentication Test Commands

```bash
# Security test suite
cd api
npm run test:auth
npm run test:security

# Manual security tests
npm run test:e2e:auth
```

#### 📊 Authentication Success Criteria

- ✅ JWT authentication works end-to-end
- ✅ All security guards function correctly
- ✅ Rate limiting prevents abuse
- ✅ Security headers are properly applied

### Step 3.2: Sistema WebSocket Avanzado y Monitoreo

#### ✅ WebSocket Validation Checklist

- [ ] **WebSocket Connection**

  ```javascript
  // Test WebSocket connection with JWT
  const socket = io('http://localhost:3001', {
    auth: { token: 'jwt_token_here' }
  });
  
  socket.on('connect', () => console.log('Connected'));
  socket.on('disconnect', () => console.log('Disconnected'));
  ```

- [ ] **Health Check Endpoints**

  ```bash
  # Test health check endpoints
  curl http://localhost:3001/websocket/health
  curl http://localhost:3001/websocket/stats
  ```

- [ ] **Connection Management**
  - [ ] Heartbeat mechanism maintains connections
  - [ ] Dead connections are cleaned up automatically
  - [ ] Rate limiting works per connection
  - [ ] Metrics are tracked correctly

- [ ] **Real-time Features**
  - [ ] Room joining and leaving works
  - [ ] Message broadcasting functions
  - [ ] Typing indicators work
  - [ ] User presence is tracked

#### 🧪 WebSocket Test Commands

```bash
# WebSocket test suite
cd api
npm run test:websocket

# Load testing with multiple connections
npm run test:websocket:load

# Health check validation
npm run test:health-checks
```

#### 📊 WebSocket Success Criteria

- ✅ WebSocket connections are stable and reliable
- ✅ Health checks provide accurate status
- ✅ Real-time features work correctly
- ✅ Performance monitoring functions properly

### Step 3.3: Sistema Avanzado de Validación, Sanitización y Logging

#### ✅ Security Validation Checklist

- [ ] **Input Validation**

  ```bash
  # Test XSS protection
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/test \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"content":"<script>alert(\"xss\")</script>"}'
  
  # Should return sanitized content
  ```

- [ ] **Error Handling**
  - [ ] Global exception filter works
  - [ ] Structured error responses
  - [ ] Proper HTTP status codes
  - [ ] User-friendly error messages

- [ ] **Logging System**
  - [ ] Structured logging format
  - [ ] Different log levels work
  - [ ] Request/response logging
  - [ ] Performance metrics logging

- [ ] **Security Features**
  - [ ] Rate limiting prevents abuse
  - [ ] File upload validation works
  - [ ] EXIF data is removed from images
  - [ ] Security headers are present

#### 🧪 Security Test Commands

```bash
# Security and validation tests
cd api
npm run test:validation
npm run test:security
npm run test:logging

# XSS and injection tests
npm run test:security:xss
npm run test:security:injection
```

#### 📊 Security Success Criteria

- ✅ All input is properly validated and sanitized
- ✅ Error handling is consistent and informative
- ✅ Logging provides adequate debugging information
- ✅ Security measures prevent common attacks

## 🎯 Phase 3 Completion Criteria

Before proceeding to Phase 4, ensure:

- ✅ All validation checklists are completed
- ✅ All test commands pass successfully
- ✅ Success criteria are met for all steps
- ✅ Authentication system is secure and reliable
- ✅ WebSocket system is stable and monitored
- ✅ Security measures are comprehensive and effective

## 📝 Next Steps

Once Phase 3 validation is complete, proceed to [Phase 4: Chat and Messaging](./phase-4-messaging.md).
