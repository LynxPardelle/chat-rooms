## üéØ TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS

### Performance Optimizations
- **Debouncing**: Typing indicators with 500ms debounce to reduce network traffic
- **Caching**: Read receipt caching with 1-minute TTL for improved response times
- **Rate Limiting**: Notification rate limiting (50 notifications/minute)
- **Auto-cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of expired typing indicators and stale data
- **Bulk Operations**: Efficient batch processing for read receipts

### Enterprise Features
- **Scalability**: Room-based state management for multi-room support
- **Reliability**: Comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms
- **Customization**: User-configurable notification settings and presence messages
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing chat infrastructure
- **Security**: Input validation and rate limiting for all new endpoints

### Real-time Capabilities
- **WebSocket Events**: 12 new event types for enhanced real-time communication
- **State Synchronization**: Automatic state sync across multiple browser tabs
- **Offline Support**: Graceful handling of connection loss and reconnection
- **Activity Tracking**: Intelligent user activity detection for auto-away functionality

## üîß TECHNICAL DETAILS

### New WebSocket Events
**Client to Server:**
- `userStartTyping` - Start typing in a room
- `userStopTyping` - Stop typing in a room
- `userPresenceUpdate` - Update user presence status
- `messageRead` - Mark message as read
- `userJoinedRoom` - Enhanced room join
- `userLeftRoom` - Enhanced room leave

**Server to Client:**
- `typingIndicatorUpdated` - Typing status changes
- `presenceUpdated` - User presence changes
- `readReceiptUpdated` - Message read status updates
- `notificationReceived` - New notifications
- `userRoomJoined` - User joined room notification
- `userRoomLeft` - User left room notification

### Service Architecture
- **TypingService**: Manages typing indicators with automatic cleanup and statistics
- **ReadReceiptService**: Tracks message delivery and read status with caching
- **NotificationService**: Handles all notification types with user preferences
- **PresenceService**: (Enhanced existing) Advanced presence management

### State Management

@SubscribeMessage('userStartTyping')
async handleUserStartTyping(client: Socket, payload: UserStartTypingPayload) {
  await this.typingService.startTyping(payload.userId, payload.roomId);
}

// TypingService with debouncing
await this.typingService.startTyping(userId, roomId); // Auto-cleanup after 3s
```

### Frontend Usage
```typescript
// Presence management
const presenceStore = usePresenceStore();
await presenceStore.setAway('In a meeting');
await presenceStore.startTyping(roomId);

// Read receipts
const readReceiptsStore = useReadReceiptsStore();
await readReceiptsStore.markMessageAsRead(messageId, roomId);
```

### Component Usage
```vue
<template>
  <PresenceIndicator :activeRoomId="currentRoom.id" />
  <ReadReceiptIndicator :messageId="message.id" :showProgress="true" />
</template>
```
