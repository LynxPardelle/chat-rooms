  - Integration with security monitoring

### 5. **Security Headers Middleware** ✅
- **SecurityHeadersMiddleware**:
  - Comprehensive HTTP security headers using Helmet
  - Content Security Policy (CSP) configuration
  - CORS handling with configurable origins
  - HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) enforcement

- **Security Features**:
  - Request ID generation for tracking
  - Sensitive endpoint detection
  - Permissions policy configuration
  - Feature restrictions and security controls

### 6. **Enhanced Global Exception Filter** ✅
- **Security Event Integration**:
  - HTTP and WebSocket exception handling
  - Rate limiting exception processing
  - Security event logging and correlation
  - Progressive IP blocking for suspicious activity

- **Error Response Features**:
  - Sanitized error messages to prevent information leakage
  - Structured error responses with security context
  - Request tracking and correlation IDs
  - Comprehensive audit trail
