# Step 6.3: User Profile Module Implementation

## Overview

This step implemented a complete User Profile Module with state management, API services, and Vue components following modern architecture principles. The profile module enables users to customize their appearance in the chat application and manage their preferences.

## Implemented Features

### 1. TypeScript Types for Profile Settings

- Created comprehensive type definitions in `profile.types.ts`
- Implemented interfaces for user profiles, settings, and preferences
- Added validation types for error handling
- Defined constants for validation constraints and accessibility standards

### 2. Pinia Store for Profile State Management

- Implemented a robust store with state, getters, and actions
- Included functionality for loading, updating, and managing profile data
- Added validation for profile settings
- Integrated with the auth store for synchronization
- Implemented color contrast calculation for accessibility compliance

### 3. API Service for Backend Communication

- Created a dedicated service for profile-related API calls
- Implemented methods for fetching and updating profile data
- Added support for avatar upload with progress tracking
- Integrated proper error handling

### 4. Vue Components for Profile Customization

- **ProfileSettings.vue**: Main container component for the profile page
- **AvatarUpload.vue**: Component for avatar selection with preview and validation
- **ColorPicker.vue**: Component for color selection with accessibility validation
- **UserPreferences.vue**: Component for managing user preferences
- **ProfileSummary.vue**: Component for displaying profile summary in chat sidebar

### 5. Integration with Chat Module

- Connected profile changes to real-time updates in chat
- Ensured avatar and color settings are reflected in messages
- Synchronized profile state with authentication state

```

## Features

- **Profile Customization**: Text color, background color, avatar
- **Avatar Management**: Upload, preview, and validation
- **Accessibility**: WCAG color contrast validation
- **User Preferences**: Notifications, online status, read receipts, sound, theme
- **Predefined Themes**: Selection of accessible color themes
- **Real-time Preview**: See how messages will appear to others

## Technical Implementation Details

- **State Management**: Used Pinia composition API for reactive state
- **Form Validation**: Implemented comprehensive validation for profile settings
- **API Integration**: RESTful API calls with proper error handling
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance for color contrast
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly UI components

## Next Steps

1. Further integrate the profile module with WebSocket for real-time updates
2. Add additional customization options (message styles, status messages)
3. Implement user profile sharing functionality
4. Enhance avatar editing capabilities with cropping functionality
5. Add profile preferences for notification preferences and privacy settings

## Testing

The Profile Module can be tested by:

1. Navigating to the Profile page
2. Modifying colors and checking contrast validation
3. Uploading a custom avatar
4. Changing preferences settings
5. Verifying changes are reflected in chat messages
6. Confirming persistence after page refresh
