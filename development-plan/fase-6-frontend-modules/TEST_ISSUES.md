# Phase 6 Component Test Issues

## Current Status
- **Total Tests**: 25
- **Passing**: 23 (92%)
- **Failing**: 2 (8%)

## Failing Tests

### 1. BaseModal > emits close event when backdrop clicked
**Issue**: Modal backdrop click event is not properly emitted when testing teleported content.
**Root Cause**: The modal uses Vue's Teleport feature to render outside the component tree, making it difficult to test backdrop clicks properly.
**Potential Solutions**:
- Mock the teleport functionality in tests
- Test the `handleOutsideClick` method directly
- Use integration tests instead of unit tests for this functionality

### 2. DataTable > handles sorting
**Issue**: Test expects different sort order than what the component actually produces.
**Root Cause**: The test assumes initial sort should put "Bob Johnson" first, but the actual sorting logic puts "John Doe" first.
**Potential Solutions**:
- Investigate the actual sorting implementation in DataTable.vue
- Update test expectations to match actual behavior
- Verify if sorting logic is correct according to requirements

## Test Coverage Summary
Overall, the component test suite is in very good shape with 92% pass rate. The failing tests are related to complex UI interactions (teleported content) and sorting logic verification rather than core functionality issues.

## Recommendations
1. Address the modal backdrop test by implementing proper teleport testing patterns
2. Verify the DataTable sorting behavior against actual requirements
3. Consider adding integration tests for complex component interactions
4. The current test failures do not block the core functionality validation
